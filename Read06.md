# How Computers Works.

Every where you looked there is a computer around you, all of us are using this technology
daily.

## 1. What makes a coumputer, a computer?

As humans we always bulid tools to help us solving our problems, about time people start to think if they can bulid a machine that could help us with the thinking work, like solving an equation, get information and save data.

In general the machine suppose to pass some steps:

- Take an Input : any thing that is entered to the computer.
- Store that input into database (memory)
- Processing : by using an algorithims
- Gives an output : the result.
  The Output on a computer, becoms an input for another computer.

these four things are commone with all computers, and that what makes a computer, a Computer.

## 2. Binary and Data.

I think you may have heard that the computer is working in one and zeros (Binary),

- 1 represent a True value
- 0 represent a False value

_this cahnge in true and false is called a (Bit)_

**Binary System : you can count any number in decimal by using 1 and 0**

Ok what about text,images,sounds?? thinks about any letter in the alphapites you can represent that letter with a number in the decimal numbers then these number could be represented with 1,0. every word you see are represented in such system.

Each images, videos are represented with millions of small pieces called **_Pixcels_**, same thing to videos, because videos shows a +30 images per second

As for sounds, they could be represented are waves called **_WaveForm_** any point can be represented to a number, more Bit means a higher range of numbers.

## 3. CPU, Memory, Input & Output

Each computer do these four basic steps , input, store, process, output. Each step is done by a specific part of the computer

- Input : Converts Physical input to binary inforamtion, keybords , touchpad , camera , sound recording , GPS

- Store : there is a memory that stores all the information that cames form input.

- Process : Central Processing Unit (CPU) it's the part which responsible to calculate informations

- OutPut : Converts information to physical output
